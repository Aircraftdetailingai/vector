          </Section>

          <Section num="2" title="Additional Work Authorization">
            If additional cutting steps, passes, or materials are required beyond the initial quote, the detailer will notify
            the customer with an updated cost adjustment before proceeding. No additional work will be performed without written
            customer approval.

          <Section num="3" title="Payment Terms">
            Payment is due upon invoice. If payment is not received within 48 hours of invoice, work in progress will be paused

            never sold, shared publicly, or linked to your identity. Shiny Jets CRM is held harmless from any use of photos by
            individual detailing businesses.
