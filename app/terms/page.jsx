            <p className="mb-3">
              Vector charges a platform fee on transactions processed through the Platform.
              The fee rate depends on your subscription tier (5% for Free, 2% for Pro, 1% for
              Business, and 0% for Enterprise). Platform fees are automatically deducted from
              payments processed through our integrated payment system.

                Platform fees are NON-REFUNDABLE once a service has been performed, regardless of
                customer satisfaction, disputes between the detailer and their customer, or any other
                circumstance. Platform fees compensate Vector for providing the software platform,
                payment processing infrastructure, hosting, and support&mdash;services that have
                already been delivered at the time of the transaction. Refunds or adjustments between
                a detailer and their customer are the sole responsibility of the detailer and do not
                entitle the detailer to a refund of platform fees.
