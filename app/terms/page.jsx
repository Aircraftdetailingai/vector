            <p>
              Vector charges a platform fee on transactions processed through the Platform.

                Customer leads generated through Vector&mdash;including but not limited to inquiries,
                quote requests, bookings, and any first contact facilitated by the Platform&mdash;must
                be processed through the Platform for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of
                first contact. This includes all subsequent quotes, invoices, payments, and service
                engagements with that customer during the 12-month period.

                of these Terms and may result in account termination and recovery of applicable
                platform fees.
